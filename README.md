Daily Scheduler---calendar for a day

## Description
Daily Scheduler is a webpage to log tasks by hour for a single workday. Users can input a task for the hour, save it to local storage, and have the task persist when the page is refreshed. User can easily see the current task with a color coded system that tracks the current time and sets each timeblock to a different color for past, present, and future hours. The webpage refreshes at the start of every hour so the webpage is always current.
